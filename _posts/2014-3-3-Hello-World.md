title: Welcome to my github page!

Although I've been coding for about 4 years I'm still fairly new to Github. Pardon the mess while I get organized.

Current projects I'm working on (some of which may be project sites hosted here):
<h3>Foundation 5</h3>
- Foundation 5 site build with SASS and Compass
- Portfolio site redesign. Static one pager with sophisticated jQuery animations. (w/Foundation for practice and why not).
- Build Mr. Pacheco's portfolio for his event emcee business.
- Migrate PBE (Pacheco Business Enterprise) from a project folder here to his live domain.

<h3>Jekyll</h3>
- Jekyll from ground up (instead of through the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) used for this site).

<h3>Ionic</h3>
- Installing a setup with applications from "scratch" (instead of the 
- Help some former coworkers with that one idea we had (not to be hosted here).

<h3>Wordpress</h3>
- Custom theme development, likely with Underscores (http://themeshaper.com/2012/10/22/the-themeshaper-wordpress-theme-tutorial-2nd-edition/).
- Custom theme development (WP on Foundation 5). Dissect an existing Foundation/Wordpress theme.
- Custom plugin development (dissect Bushido plugin and build a custom plugin of my own that changes login branding and backend menu colors for Wordpress utilizing SASS, perhaps integrate a dropdown menu with different backend color schemes).
- With this setup, Github is the "CMS". I have plans to figure out how to serve up Wordpresses as a static page with Jekkyl in order to make it less "hackable" (I believe the plugin already exists).

<h3>JQuery</h3>
- Add more functions to [JQcircus](http://jqcircus.offgrouse.com).
- Host JQ circus here.
- Integrate my own parallax into my own theme. Especially with switching background images through scrolling (behind a cover div).
